"""Tests for state_machine module - validates state transitions."""

# This module is tested through integration tests in test_react_machina.py
# This project favors real code over mocks and tests behavior through the public API.
# Custom exceptions are validated when they are raised during actual tool execution
# and error handling scenarios.
#
# See tests/TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md for more details on our testing philosophy.
